## [My goals in life](#goals-in-life)

1. Help people. Whatever I'm mentally invested in, it should be something that either improves the situation on our planet earth or that advances science. Doing both would be nice.
2. Meet interesting people that challenge my beliefs and from whom I can learn.
3. Create interesting...things. Innovative would be great, but that's not something you can force, now can't you? Topics I'm most interested in are robotics, genetics, space travel, telepathy and artificial intelligence in general.

I wrote a longer article about all of this [here](https://troessner.svbtle.com/so-whats-the-whole-point-of-everything).

## [My inspirations](#my-inspirations)

There are many inspirations and inspirational people in my life. A more or less random selection of the top of my head:

- Mathematicians. My top five:
    1. [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid). I especially love his proof that [there are infinitely many primes](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html)
    2. [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) for being the most prolific mathematician ever.
    3. [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) for coming up with the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem) at the age of 15.
    4. [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) who died too early to become a second Euler.
    5. [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) for the [Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine)

- Physicists. Especially everybody that is featured regularly on the best physics channel there is, [Sixty Symbols](https://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols). Other than that I'm fascinated by the early 20th century, which means more or less everybody that attended the [1927 Solvay conference](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Solvay_conference_1927.jpg/700px-Solvay_conference_1927.jpg), Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Nils Bohr, Marie Curie...

- AI Scientists like [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/), [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) or [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

- Social activists like [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) or organisations like [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/)

- Psychologist and motivational speakers like [Tony Robbins](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do) or [Carol Dweck](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-73105)

- Entrepreneurs like [Tony Hsieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh) or [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). I know it's lame but I also believe Steve Jobs was a genius :)

- Inventors like [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) or [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)

My favourite inspirational quote at the moment is from Aaron Swartz:

> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.

I follow this advice and try to read as widely as possible  - you can check out my favorite books, newsletters and articles [on my blog](https://troessner.svbtle.com/you-are-what-you-read-watch-and-listen-to).

## [What I bring to the table](#what-i-bring-to-the-table)

- Excellence in software engineering. I’ve been doing this for the last 15 years and I’m obsessed with code quality and writing elegant, maintainable code. I am a regular open source contributor and maintainer of a couple of more or less popular gems. Most notably of the awesome [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) gem - check out [my github profile](https://github.com/troessner/) for more. Additionally you can find quite a few mostly technical articles on [my blog](https://troessner.github.io/articles/).

- Building up teams by recruiting the best people. I'd go as far as to say that team play is 10 times more important than "being an expert" since it's far easier to become good at something than transitioning from being a douche to somebody who can carry and motivate a team. You can read up on my recruiting philosophy [here](https://troessner.github.io/articles/2016-08-15-the-rockstar-ninja-coder-and-you.html).

- Motivation and the passion to motivate others: I believe that vision and purpose on the high level, clear responsibilities and maximum autonomy are the keys to high productivity and happiness.

- The passion to create something that might change change the world. I don't care much for money - my motivation lies elsewhere. This doesn't mean that I work for free, just that I value other things more.

## [Technologies I have worked with](#technologies-i-have-worked-with)

- Languages: There's hardly a language I can't find anything positive about it. I have worked with a lot of dynamic languages like Ruby, PHP, Python, javascript and static languages like Java. I also like esoteric languages like brainfuck or whitespace for the fun of it.
- Databases: Over the course of the years I have worked with good old SQL databases (PostgreSQL, mySQL), NoSQL databases (Redis and friends) and Big Data databases (Hbase / Hadoop).
- I spent the majority of my career focusing on backend development (mostly API / SOA environments) but have spent enough time in frontend and mobile development to know my way around.
- Other than that I like and have worked with Amazon cloud, google cloud, git, git branches (yes!), test driven / behaviour driven development and [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

## [My leadership philosophy](#my-leadership-philosophy)

When it comes to leadership I have 2 core beliefs:

**What makes humans productive?**

- Sharing a common vision that means something to you and others.
- Clearly defined responsibilities. Not in a limiting "you're not allowed to do that" way but rather in a "I know who's taking care of what" way
- Maximum autonomy. Most startups get this part right because it's the easiest one. Unfortunately it's also the one that can quickly make people unproductive and unhappy when you fuck up the first two items

**What is leadership?**

- Vision. At least a third of your time should only be invested in developing, nurturing and communicating the vision.
- Mission. That does not mean being involved in the details. That means roadmap and high level metrics.
- Team building

## [Voluntary work](#voluntary-work)

I currently volunteer as a German teacher for refugees at the [Offene Tuer](http://sprengelhaus-wedding.de/offene-tuer-e-v/). I also help out occasionally at the [Berliner Obdachlosenhilfe](http://www.berliner-obdachlosenhilfe.de/) handing out food to homeless people.
