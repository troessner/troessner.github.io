Hey there,

I'm a software developer turned leader living in Berlin. I have spent almost all of my professional life in startups and probably wouldn't last 1 week in a traditional corporation. I'm currently working as the Head of Engineering for Nas Academy to change education all around the world.

## [My inspirations](#my-inspirations)

There are many inspirations and inspirational people in my life:

- Mathematicians. My top 3:
    1. [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid). I especially love his proof that [there are infinitely many primes](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html)
    2. [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) who died too early to become a second Euler.
    3. [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) for the [Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine) conjecture.

- Physicists. Especially everybody that is featured regularly on the best physics channel there is, [Sixty Symbols](https://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols). Other than that I'm fascinated by the early 20th century, which means more or less everybody that attended the [1927 Solvay conference](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Solvay_conference_1927.jpg/700px-Solvay_conference_1927.jpg), Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Nils Bohr, Marie Curie...

- AI Scientists like [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/), [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) or [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

- Social activists like [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)

- Psychologist and motivational speakers like [Tony Robbins](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do) or [Carol Dweck](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-73105)

- Entrepreneurs like [Tony Hsieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh) or [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). I know it's lame but I also believe Steve Jobs was a genius :)

- Inventors like [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) or [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)

My favourite inspirational quote is from Aaron Swartz:

> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.

## [My interests](#my-interests)

Being silly and doing silly things with my daughter is certainly one of my favorite pastimes. When I'm not doing that I'm flying an aircraft or at least trying to - I'm currently in the process of getting my pilot licence. Once I have accomplished this (which given the difficulty of, you know, flying would be one of my major life achievements) I'm hoping to buy a beautiful [Cirrus SR22](https://cirrusaircraft.com/aircraft/sr22/) or an [extra300](https://www.extraaircraft.com/) so I can visit each country on this planet flying there with my own aircraft. Yeah, I said that unironically ;)

Other than that I have been training Brazilian jiu-jitsu for quite a few years now and still do so even though I really suck at it. And finally I love math and physics (all sciences really, but you gotta make some concessions since you can't do it all) and am studying math on the side being enrolled in a remote university.

## [Voluntary work](#voluntary-work)

* One of my most recent activity was giving introductory programming lessons to female immigrants in refugee camps for the [ReDi school](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin) in Berlin.
* I still regularly mentor and coach the kids I taught in the programming classes above.
* I used to volunteer as a German teacher for refugees at the [Offene Tuer](http://sprengelhaus-wedding.de/offene-tuer-e-v/).
* I help out occasionally at the [Berliner Obdachlosenhilfe](http://www.berliner-obdachlosenhilfe.de/) handing out food to homeless people.

## [Education](#education)

* I have a Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics from the [Freie Universität Berlin](http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) in 2005.
* I am currently studying mathematics on the side with the final goal of getting a PHD.

## [What I am doing professionally](#what-i-am-doing-professionally)

In one short sentence: Team building & [Blitzscaling](https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling): 

> Blitzscaling is what you do when you need to grow really, really quickly. It’s the science and art of rapidly building out a company to serve a large and usually global market, with the goal of becoming the first mover at scale.

This happens mostly in a software engineering context but is naturally not limited to it - I am used to collaborate closely and contribute to HR, recruiting, marketing and sales.

To make this a bit more tangible, recurring activities for me are:

- Leadership coaching
- Goal setting both on a team level and on a department-wide scale
- Strategic initiatives, e.g. career development, career ladder, technical and managerial initiatives across the engineering department
- Team building
- Boosting team productivity and happiness

## [What I bring to the table](#what-i-bring-to-the-table)

- A love for people management and seeing them realize their full potential. 

- Building up teams by recruiting the best people. I'd go as far as to say that team play is 10 times more important than "being an expert" since it's far easier to become good at something than transitioning from being a douche to somebody who can carry and motivate a team. You can read up on my recruiting philosophy [here](https://troessner.github.io/articles/2016-08-15-the-rockstar-ninja-coder-and-you.html).

- Motivation and the passion to motivate others: I believe that vision and purpose on the high level, clear responsibilities and maximum autonomy are the keys to high productivity and happiness.

- The passion to create something that might change change the world. I don't care much for money - my motivation lies elsewhere. This doesn't mean that I work for free, just that I value other things more.

- Excellence in software engineering. I’m obsessed with code quality and writing elegant, maintainable code. I am a regular open source contributor and maintainer of a couple of more or less popular gems. Most notably of the awesome [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) gem - check out [my github profile](https://github.com/troessner/) for more. Additionally you can find quite a few mostly technical articles on [my blog](https://troessner.github.io/articles/).


## [Technologies I have worked with](#technologies-i-have-worked-with)

I have been fully focused on management for the last couple of years or so but back in the day I was a software developer working with a variety of technologies:

- Languages: There's hardly a language I can't find anything positive about it. I have worked with a lot of dynamic languages like Ruby, PHP, Python, javascript and static languages like Java. I also like esoteric languages like brainfuck or whitespace for the fun of it.
- Databases: Over the course of the years I have worked with good old SQL databases (PostgreSQL, mySQL), NoSQL databases (Redis and friends) and Big Data databases (Hbase / Hadoop).
- I spent the majority of my career focusing on backend development (mostly API / SOA environments) but have spent enough time in frontend and mobile development to know my way around.
- Other than that I like and have worked with Amazon cloud, google cloud, git, git branches (yes!), test driven / behaviour driven development and [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).
